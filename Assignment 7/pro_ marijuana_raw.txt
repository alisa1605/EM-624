Marijuana legalization boosts the economy. The marijuana industry (adult-use and medical) in the United States could exceed $24 billion in revenue by 2025. [7] For every $1.00 spent in the marijuana industry, between $2.13 and $2.40 in economic activity is generated. [1][2] Tourism, banking, food, real estate, construction, and transportation are a few of the industries that benefit from legal marijuana. [3]

The legal marijuana industry generated $7.2 billion in economic activity in 2016, and added millions of dollars in federal taxes paid by cannabis businesses. [20] One study on adult-use marijuana in Nevada projected $7.5 billion in economic activity over the first seven years of legalization, including $1.7 billion in labor income. [4] A study by the University of California Agricultural Issues Center estimated that the legal marijuana market in California could generate $5 billion annually. [5][6]

In Colorado, marijuana brings in three times more tax revenue than alcohol. [15] The state raised $78 million in the first fiscal year after starting retail sales, and $129 million the second fiscal year. Washington collected a total of $220 million in tax revenues in its second fiscal year of sales. [53][52]



Legalizing marijuana results in decreased teen marijuana use. Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine found that "the rates of marijuana use by young people are falling despite the fact more US states are legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana use and the number of adults using the drug has increased." [38] Marijuana use among 8th graders in Washington state decreased following legalization in 2012, from 9.8 percent to 7.3 percent in 2014/2016, according to a Dec. 2018 report from RAND. [254] A study from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that past-year marijuana use decreased by 17%, from 15.8% in 2002 to 13.1% in 2014, among US kids ages 12 to 17. [37][41] Colorado teens between 12 and 17 years old reported a nearly 12% drop in marijuana use just two years after adult use was legalized, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. [39][40]

The Marijuana Policy Project, an organization that leads marijuana legalization campaigns, said, "Study after study has confirmed that marijuana policy reforms do not cause rates of youth marijuana use to increase... The most in-depth state surveys suggest modest decreases in rates of youth marijuana use in Colorado and Washington." [42] Even though retail marijuana shops opened in Colorado and Washington in 2014, past-year marijuana use among teens in those states was lower in 2015-2016 than in 2014-2015. [39]



Traffic deaths and arrests for DUIs do not increase, and may decrease, when marijuana is legalized. Traffic deaths dropped 11% on average in states that legalized medical marijuana. [65] Arrests for driving under the influence have decreased in Washington and Colorado. [49] Benjamin Hansen, an economics professor at the University of Oregon at Eugene who studied traffic deaths post-medical marijuana legalization, stated that "Public safety doesn't decrease with increased access to marijuana, rather it improves." [65]

Studies show that drivers under the influence of marijuana tend to be more cautious and take fewer risks than drunk drivers, such as making fewer lane changes and reducing speed. [29][74] A fact sheet about marijuana's effects on drivers posted on the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration website stated that "Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for self-perceived impairment." [66]




Legal marijuana is regulated for consumer safety. People buying marijuana on the street have no way of knowing if what they're ingesting is covered with mold, fungus, pesticides, or other harmful substances. [8][9] Once marijuana is legalized, the government is able to enforce laboratory testing and regulations to ensure that marijuana is free of toxins. [10] For example, Washington law requires health warnings, quality assurance, labeling for the concentration of THC, and other important regulations for consumers. [11]

Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska all passed regulations to prevent kids' exposure to marijuana, including child-resistant packaging. [12] Legalization allows the government to set age restrictions on buyers and to license and regulate the entire supply chain of marijuana, including growers, distributors, retailers, and testing laboratories. [13] California regulations include limitations on the serving sizes for edible marijuana products, seed-to-sale testing and tracking, and 24-hour video surveillance at retail stores. [14]



Legalization of marijuana is phasing out black markets and taking money away from drug cartels, organized crime, and street gangs. Data from the US Border Patrol show that marijuana seizures have decreased by millions of pounds and are at their lowest levels in over a decade, indicating that legal domestic production is decreasing demand for marijuana smuggled in from Mexico. [17][18] A Mexican cannabis farmer told NPR, "If the US continues to legalize pot, they'll run us into the ground." [19] According to the ACLU, legalization in Colorado and Washington has cost Mexican drug cartels an estimated $2.7 billion in profits. [21]

Stephen Downing, a retired deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said, "There's no question that ending today's prohibition on drugs -- starting with marijuana -- would do more to hurt the cartels than any level of law enforcement skill or dedication ever can." [62] By the year 2020, an estimated 90% of the marijuana market in Colorado will be supplied by licensed and taxed vendors, demonstrating that the black market can be replaced by legal, regulated sales. [15][16][22]


The enforcement of marijuana prohibition is racist because people of color are disproportionately impacted. Statistics show a significant racial disparity in the enforcement of marijuana laws: even though white and black people use marijuana at roughly the same rate, a black person in the United States is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession on average. [24] In Iowa, the state with the highest inequity, black people are 8.3 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people. [21] In New York City, 15.8% of marijuana possession cases involving white people result in conviction, compared to 32.3% involving black people and 30% involving Hispanic people. [27]

Marijuana possession convictions can impact people's ability to get public housing, financial aid for school, loans, and jobs. [21] Over the past ten years, drug sentences for black men have been 9% to 13% longer than those received by white men. [28] Margaret Dooley-Sammuli, Criminal Justice and Drug Policy director for the ACLU of California, stated, "Racial disparities in marijuana enforcement are widespread and longstanding." [26] Legalizing marijuana would help correct the disparity.



Crime goes down when marijuana is legalized. Studies show that medical marijuana dispensaries decreased crime in their neighborhoods because of an increased security presence and more people walking around the area. [30]

Research indicates that people drink less and alcohol sales drop in places where marijuana is legalized. [36][35][23] The amount of crime and violence caused by alcohol use is ten times higher than by marijuana use and alcohol is a factor in around 40% of violent crimes. [33][32] A shift from drinking to cannabis use will decrease crimes associated with alcohol, such as domestic violence and assault. According to FBI crime statistics, violent crime in Washington decreased in the years after legalization (295.6 violent offenses reported per 100,000 Washington residents in 2011 vs. 284.4 violent offenses per 100,000 people in 2015). [31]

Taylor West, former deputy director for the National Cannabis Industry Association, said, "We're not seeing any increase in crime rates through marijuana — we're seeing lower crime rates, and there are good rational reasons for that: We're really beginning to cripple the criminal market, which is where violence actually occurs." [71]



Legalizing marijuana would end the costly enforcement of marijuana laws and free up police resources. Arresting people for marijuana possession costs the United States between $1.19 billion and $6.03 billion annually. [24][21] These costs include police, judicial, legal, and corrections expenses. Incarcerating marijuana offenders costs the United States an estimated $600 million per year. [63] Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has estimated that marijuana legalization would save between $7.7 billion and $13.7 billion annually. [60][61]

Instead of arresting people for marijuana, police officers could focus on serious crimes including rape, assault, and homicide. [62] For example, marijuana legalization in Washington significantly freed up law enforcement resources; marijuana possession arrests dropped from 5,531 the year before legalization to 120 the year after. [64]

Howard Wooldridge, a former police detective from Michigan who co-founded LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), said, "Marijuana prohibition is a horrible waste of good police time. Every hour spent looking for pot reduces public safety." [169]



Marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, which are already legal. Alcohol and tobacco are legal, yet they are known to cause cancer, heart failure, liver damage, and more. According to the CDC, six people die from alcohol poisoning every day and 88,000 people die annually due to excessive alcohol use in the United States. [45][168] There are no recorded cases of death from marijuana overdose. [46][47]

Three to four times as many Americans are dependent on alcohol as on marijuana. [33] A study in the Lancet ranking the harmfulness of drugs put alcohol first as the most harmful, tobacco as sixth, and cannabis eighth. [48] A national poll found that people view tobacco as a greater threat to health than marijuana by a margin of four to one (76% vs. 18%), and 72% of people surveyed believed that regular use of alcohol was more dangerous than marijuana use. [43]

"In several respects, even sugar poses more of a threat to our nation's health than pot," said Dr. David L. Nathan, a clinical psychiatrist and president of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation. [44]



Taxes collected from the legal sale of marijuana support important public programs. Tax revenues in legal marijuana states provide funding to the police, drug treatment and mental health centers, and housing programs, along with school programs such as anti-bullying campaigns, youth mentoring, and public school grants. [49][73] "The impact is really felt at the local level. Some counties have done 20 years of infrastructure work in just one year's time. They've provided lunch for kids who need it," said Brian Vicente, partner at Vicente Sederberg LLC, a law firm specializing in the marijuana industry. [50]

In Colorado, $40 million of marijuana tax revenue went to public school construction, while $105 million went to housing programs, mental health programs in jails, and health programs in middle schools in 2016-2017. [51][52]



Legalizing marijuana creates thousands of needed jobs. There were an estimated 122,814 legal full-time marijuana jobs in the United States as of Jan. 2017. [54] A report from New Frontier Data found that the cannabis industry could create a quarter of a million new jobs by 2020. [55][56][57] An economic impact estimate from the Marijuana Policy Group forecast the creation of more than 130,000 jobs in California following legalization. [15][59] Within a few years of legalization, approximately 18,000 additional full-time jobs were created in Colorado annually, both in the actual marijuana business as well as in related fields such as security and real estate. [15] Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) stated that the cannabis industry in the United States "is expected to produce nearly 300,000 jobs by 2020 and grow to $24 billion by 2025." [20]



A majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana. A 2018 Gallup poll found a record-high 66% support for legalizing marijuana, up from 12% in 1969, the first year the polling company asked about marijuana. [249] The poll first surpassed 50% support in 2011. According to Gallup, "the transformation in public attitudes about marijuana over the past half-century has mirrored the liberalization of public attitudes about gay rights and the same-sex-marriage movement." [67] While Democrats (72%) and Independents (67%) have been more likely to back legalization, a majority of Republicans (51%) now agree. [67] Polls by CBS News and the AP both found that 61% of Americans favor legalizing marijuana. [68][170]

The public clearly supports changing our failed anti-marijuana policies. [69] More than half of US states have legalized medical marijuana, and 40 states took some action to relax their drug laws (such as decriminalizing or lowering penalties for possession) between 2009 and 2013. [70]




The government doesn't have the right to tell adults what they can put in their own bodies. David Boaz, Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute, said, "people have the right to live their lives in any way they choose so long as they don't violate the equal rights of others. What right could be more basic, more inherent in human nature, than the right to choose what substances to put in one's own body?" [72] More than 3,500 people die from drowning every year in the United States, but the government wouldn't arrest people for owning swimming pools. [76] Over 30,000 people are killed annually in car accidents, but the government doesn't outlaw driving. [92] Adults should be allowed to make adult decisions about how they choose to relax or have fun without government interference, especially when they're not hurting anyone. [75]

US Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) said, "There is no doubt in my mind that the federal government should not be in the marijuana prohibition business... From every perspective—a libertarian perspective, fiscal conservative's perspective, Christian evangelical perspective, progressive perspective—marijuana prohibition is just wrong." [77]
