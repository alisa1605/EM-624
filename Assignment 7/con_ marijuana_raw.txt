Legalized marijuana creates steep costs for society and taxpayers that far outweigh its tax revenues. Marijuana use harms more than just the person using the drug. [129] Societal costs of marijuana use include paying for increased emergency room visits, medical care, and addiction treatment for the uninsured; more victims of drugged driving accidents; increased crime; and a negative impact on health from secondhand smoke. [78][102]

Annual societal costs from alcohol ($223.5 billion) and tobacco ($193 billion) far exceed the $24 billion in tax revenues they raise. [128][128][131][172] Money raised from legal marijuana taxes generally accounts for less than 1% of a state's tax revenue. [132][134]

Legalizing marijuana would put one more harmful substance in our society that costs more than the revenue it generates. [130] According to the Pew Research Center, "the most frequently mentioned reason why people oppose legalization is that marijuana generally hurts society." [133]



Legalizing marijuana increases use by teens, with harmful results. The percentage of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana is higher in every legal marijuana state than the national average. For example, 16.21% of Colorado teens and 18.86% of teens in Alaska reported marijuana use in the past year, compared to an average of 12.29% for the United States overall in 2015-2016. [39] Colorado past-month teen marijuana use jumped 20% in the two-year average after marijuana was legalized for adults. [78]

Marijuana is especially dangerous for young people, because human brains are not fully developed until around age 25 (four years past the legal age in states that allow recreational marijuana). [79][80] The American Academy of Pediatrics said that adverse effects of teen marijuana use include "impaired short-term memory and decreased concentration, attention span, and problem solving, which clearly interfere with learning. Alterations in motor control, coordination, judgment, reaction time, and tracking ability have also been documented; these may contribute to unintentional deaths and injuries." [156] Studies show that students who use cannabis perform worse in school. [81]



Traffic accidents and deaths increase when marijuana is legalized. Marijuana-related traffic deaths rose 62% following the legalization of marijuana in Colorado. [78] Jim Leal, former Chief of Police of Newark, California, said of legalizing marijuana, "You are commercializing a product that is just going to put more impaired drivers on the road, worsening a problem that we already have. What officers are seeing with THC levels being very high is they are seeing impairment being far worse than they have ever seen in the past." [158]

The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety reported that fatal crashes involving marijuana doubled after legalization in Washington. Marshall Doney, President and CEO of AAA, said, "Marijuana can affect driver safety by impairing vehicle control and judgment." [159] The Highway Loss Data Institute found an increased crash risk in legal marijuana states and said collision claims in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington increased 6% as compared to states that don't have legal marijuana. [83][84] [85][252] A meta-study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) concluded that "Cannabis use prior to driving increases the risk of being involved in a motor vehicle accident." [255]




Marijuana is addictive, and dependence on the drug will increase with legalization. Heavy users who stop using marijuana may suffer withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia, depression, anxiety, nausea, chills, and stomach pain. [91][95] According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as many as four million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder, such as abuse, dependence, or addiction. [95][96][97] Dr. Drew Pinsky, a board-certified internist and addiction medicine specialist, said, "I've been treating cannabis addiction for 20 years. When people are addicted to cannabis, cocaine and alcohol the drug they have the most difficult time giving up is the cannabis." [93]

A study in the Journal of Drug Issues found that the number of US daily marijuana users has risen dramatically since 2002 and now 68% of users report daily or near-daily use. [98] Kevin Sabet, director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, wrote, "The scientific verdict is that marijuana can be addictive and dangerous... Many baby boomers have a hard time understanding this simply because today's marijuana can be so much stronger than the marijuana of the past." [160]



The black market and organized crime benefit from marijuana legalization. Law enforcement says that legal marijuana has actually enhanced opportunities for the black market. [134] Prices charged by state-licensed sellers can easily be undercut by cartels. [173] A drug dealer told Vice News, "Right now with the way the tax structure is in Washington, the black market is going to thrive." [135]

In Colorado, a sharp increase in marijuana-related charges filed under the state's Organized Crime Control Act coincided with the legalization of marijuana, indicating a rise in organized crime. [102] The Colorado Attorney General's office stated that legalization "has inadvertently helped fuel the business of Mexican drug cartels... cartels are now trading drugs like heroin for marijuana, and the trade has since opened the door to drug and human trafficking." [134] Local officials said that Mexican cartels were growing marijuana under the cover of legal operations in Colorado and using that to fuel the black market in other states. [134][174]



Legalizing marijuana leads to more marijuana-related medical emergencies. After retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, emergency room visits related to marijuana shot up nearly 30% and hospitalizations related to marijuana rose 200%. [78][171][100][102] "The emergency department has seen increased visits for primary care needs, breathing problems related to inhalation of marijuana, including asthma, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections, as well as psychiatric needs, accidental or intentional overdoses and, unfortunately, increased pediatric patients with issues related to marijuana," said Dr. Karen Randall, an emergency room physician in Colorado. [78]

People are used to the idea that a candy bar is a single serving size, but a candy bar with marijuana could have four or more times the recommended dose of THC, depending on the state's regulations. [104] People end up in the ER with anxiety attacks or psychotic-like symptoms from eating sweets infused with more marijuana than they were expecting--or, in some cases, not expecting at all. [105]

Poison-control marijuana exposure cases for kids ages 9 and under increased more than five-fold in Colorado after legalization. [12] NAS found "increased risk of unintentional cannabis overdose injuries among children" in legal marijuana states. [255] The University of Colorado burn center reported a "substantial increase" in the number of marijuana-related burns after legalization. [161]



Marijuana use harms the brain, and legalization will increase mental health problems. Cannabis use may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. [108][109] Researchers at Harvard and Northwestern found that recreational marijuana smokers showed abnormalities in the shape, volume, and density of certain areas of the brain. [107][110]

Dr. Hans Breiter, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital who co-authored the study, said, "People think a little marijuana shouldn't cause a problem if someone is doing O.K. with work or school. Our data directly says this is not so." [111] A British Journal of Psychiatry study stated, "There is good evidence that taking cannabis leads to acute adverse mental effects in a high proportion of regular users." [112]

A survey published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal reported that 22% of marijuana users experienced "acute anxiety or panic attacks following cannabis use," and 15% had psychotic symptoms following use. [113]



Marijuana harms the health of users and people around them. Smoking marijuana can damage lung tissues and cause respiratory problems; secondhand marijuana smoke is also dangerous. [134][114][115] Research shows that smoking one marijuana joint is as damaging to the lungs as five tobacco cigarettes. [116][164] Marijuana may contain five times as much carbon monoxide concentration and three times as much tar as tobacco. [115] There is a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes in the hours immediately after smoking cannabis. [162]

A study found that using a vaporization device "likely leads to enhanced ingestion of toxic ammonia known to result in neurobehavioral impairment." [119][118] Ammonia ingested while vaping can result in lung irritation, nervous system effects, and asthma attacks. [120]



Commercialized marijuana will create a "Big Marijuana" industry that exploits people for profit and targets children. "Big Marijuana" is already using similar tactics to "Big Tobacco," which marketed cigarettes using ads that appealed to kids, including the Joe Camel cartoon character. [129][149] Marijuana food products that are colorful, sweet, or branded with cartoons are most likely to attract children. [103] Marijuana is available in kid-friendly forms such as gummy bears and lollipops, and products sometimes resemble familiar brands, such as "Buddahfinger" or "KeefKat" in wrappers that look like a Butterfinger or KitKat candy bar. [167][134]

Mark A. R. Kleiman, a drug policy expert, said, "[I]f you're in the [for-profit] cannabis business, casual users aren't much use to you while heavy users are your best customers, accounting for the bulk of your sales... the commercial interest demands maximizing problem use." [147] Rosalie Liccardo Pacula, senior economist at RAND Corporation, said heavy marijuana users account for the "vast majority of the total amount sold and/or consumed." [148]



Legalizing marijuana hurts businesses by causing preventable accidents and lost productivity. Workplace incidents involving employees under the influence of marijuana increased from 6% to 20% the year after legalization in Colorado. [134][124] Employees who screened positive for marijuana use had 55% more industrial accidents, 85% more injuries, and absenteeism rates 75% higher than those who tested negative, according to a study done on postal workers. [125][126] Paul L. Bittner, partner and vice chair of the Labor and Employment Group at Ice Miller law firm, said, "You not only lose productivity, but the bigger concern for employers is potential liability if there's an accident and someone gets hurt or killed." [122]

Researchers found that using marijuana even just once a week can impact the parts of the brain that are linked to motivation, sometimes in irreversible ways. [165] Long-term marijuana users produce less dopamine, a neurochemical considered crucial to summoning motivation. [166] People who smoked marijuana in the previous year reported less dedication to their jobs than non-marijuana users, according to a study in the journal Addiction. [127]



The United States has signed international treaties that prevent us from legalizing marijuana. Three United Nations treaties set worldwide drug controls. [137][138] As a party to the treaties, the United States has agreed to limit the use of marijuana "exclusively to medical and scientific purposes." [139] The move by some US states to legalize adult-use marijuana has upset the UN monitoring organization, which stated that legalization "cannot be reconciled with the legal obligation" to uphold the Single Convention treaty. [136]

Legalizing marijuana puts the United States in a position of weakness when we need to hold other nations accountable to legal agreements. [139] "It is a path the United States—with its strong interest in international institutions and the rule of law—should tread with great caution," wrote Wells Bennett, a Fellow in National Security Law at the Brookings Institution, and John Walsh, Senior Associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. [139]



Legalizing marijuana is opposed by major public health organizations. Some of the public health associations that oppose legalizing marijuana for recreational use include the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. [151][94][152][153][154]

"Legalization campaigns that imply that marijuana is a benign substance present a significant challenge for educating the public about its known risks and adverse effects," the American Academy of Pediatrics said. [156] The ASAM "does not support the legalization of marijuana and recommends that jurisdictions that have not acted to legalize marijuana be most cautious and not adopt a policy of legalization until more can be learned." [94] The AMA "believes that (1) cannabis is a dangerous drug and as such is a public health concern; (2) sale of cannabis should not be legalized." [157]




Growing marijuana harms the environment. Marijuana cultivation results in deforestation, soil erosion, habitat destruction, and river diversion. [142][140] Cannabis plants require nearly double the amount of water needed to grow grapes or tomatoes. [144][145] Rosamond Naylor, Senior Fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, said, "Taking water directly from rivers and streams in the summer [to grow marijuana] not only reduces the water available for agriculture but also threatens wildlife species... Regardless of the legal status of marijuana, the way we are currently managing its impacts on water and wildlife in California just doesn't work." [142]

Legal indoor growing requires a lot of electricity for lighting, heating, and ventilation. This produces an amount of greenhouse gas emissions equal to that of three million cars each year, and places a burden on public utilities. [141]
